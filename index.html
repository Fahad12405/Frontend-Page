                <h3>2004–2005: Success at youth level:</h3>
                <p>
                              As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team
                            of both countries.[370] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in
                            2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the 
                            Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired
                            to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from 
                            him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June
                                2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as 
                                an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, 
                            made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two
                            assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the
                            South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he 
                            lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone 
                            , he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the
                            match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match 
                            Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth 
                            Championship.

                <h3>2005–2006: Senior and World Cup debuts:</h3>
                <p>
                    In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman
                     gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18
                     , Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came
                      on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul 
                      against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with
                       his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an 
                       intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[374] Messi was reportedly found
                        weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[375] He returned to the team on
                         3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared
                          his "re-debut" ahead of the match.[376] Messi started his first game in the next
                           qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty 
                           that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as "a jewel".
                           [377] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's
                            participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly
                             against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[378] A hamstring injury sustained a week
                              later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless 
                              selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of 
                              the tournament.
                </p>
                <h3>2007–2008: Copa América final and Olympic gold:</h3>
                <p>
                    As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio
                     Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007
                      Copa América, held in Venezuela.[61][388] He set up the game-winning goal of their
                       4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty
                        that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against
                         Colombia.[389][390] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced
                          Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the
                           semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure
                            another 3–0 win.[388] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a
                             Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[391] Their
                              unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi 
                              was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player
                               Juan Román Riquelme.[388] He was named the best young player of the 
                               tournament by CONMEBOL.
                </p>
                <h3>2008–2011: Collective decline:</h3>
                <p>
                    From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor
                     performances.[388] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup
                      victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing 
                      their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last
                       qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which 
                       included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under
                        Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in
                         the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[378][397] During that game,
                          played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time,
                           following the international retirement of Riquelme.[398] Overall, Messi scored 
                           four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[378] Ahead of the
                            tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input;
                             Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two
                              strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football,
                               which had been his preferred position since childhood.
                </p>
                <h3>2011–2013: Assuming the captaincy:</h3>
                <p>

                    After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced
                     by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the
                      24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier
                      Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their
                       best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field
                        leader and motivator.[405][406] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella 
                        dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth 
                        Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team,
                         Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying
                          match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in 
                          two-and-a-half years.
                          <br><br>

                    Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored 
                    only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 
                    appearances during the following three years.[378][405] He netted a total of 12 goals
                     in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for
                      the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[407] His first international
                       hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more
                        hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi
                         then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay
                          on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally 
                          to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had
                           scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[378][408] Concurrently
                            with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually
                             began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.
                </p>
                <h3>2014–2015: World Cup and Copa América finals:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an
                     unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament,
                      however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.
                       In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina;
                        he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three
                         players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.
                         During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end
                          the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[411] He scored
                           twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a
                            free kick, as they finished first in their group.[412] Messi assisted a late goal in extra 
                            time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0
                             quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup
                              for the first time since 1990.[413][414] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated 
                              the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's
                               first penalty.
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final
                                was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[416] Within the first half-hour,
                                 Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several 
                                 opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the 
                                 second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally 
                                 scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi 
                                 sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[417] At the conclusion of
                                  the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition 
                                  to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most
                                   chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and
                                    produced the most throughballs in the competition.[409][418] However, his selection drew 
                                    criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed
                                     his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing
                                      purposes.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>
                                      As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina 
                                       the knockout stage as group winners.[424] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, 
                                       including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and
                                        ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with
                                         Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[425] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a
                                          playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory
                                           over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[424] Argentina started
                                            the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout
                                             after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking 
                                             a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to
                                              successfully convert his penalty.[426] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly 
                                              selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[427] As Argentina
                                               continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats 
                                               again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.

                <h3>2016–2017: Third Copa América final, first retirement, and return:</h3>
                <p>
                    On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017.
                     He was also fined CHF 10,000.On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was
                      lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant 
                       could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[453] Argentina's place in the 2018 
                       World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their 
                       group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked 
                       failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led
                        his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind 
                        to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.
                         Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL 
                         world Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous
                          record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[454]

                </h3>
                <p>
                    In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium,
                     Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory,
                      becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in
                       three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup
                        in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[462] A goal of the tournament contender,
                         Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two
                          touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[463][464] 
                          He was awarded Man of the Match.[465] Argentina progressed to the second round as group
                           runners-up behind Croatia.[466] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France
                            on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat,
                             which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[467] With his two assists in his team's
                              second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last
                               four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match
                                for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.<br><br>


Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and
 Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for
  the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure
   to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from 
   international football once again.[470] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina 
   squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[471] A
    conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to 
    retire.[472] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela,
     in Madrid.

                <h3>2019–2020: Copa América third-place and suspension:</h3>

                <p>
                    On 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni's final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América
                    .[474] In Argentina's second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal
                     from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[475] After coming under criticism in the media 
                     over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the 
                     Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also
                      criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[476] Following Argentina's 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil
                       in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match,[477][478] and
                        alleged the competition was "set up" for Brazil to win.[479]
                    <br><br>

In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 
2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in
 the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[480] Following
  the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments
   following the semi-final led to his sending off.[481] Messi later issued an apology for his comments,
    but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's 
    next World Cup qualifier.[482] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international 
    football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban 
    meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and
     October.[483] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil,
      scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[484] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored 
      a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup
       qualifying campaign.[485]

                <h3>2021–2022: Copa América and World Cup triumph:</h3>
                <p>
                    On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's 
                    opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[487] On 21 June, Messi played in
                     his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina
                      in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[488] A week later, he broke
                       the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against
                        Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring 
                        two.[489] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador
                         in the quarter-finals of the competition.[490] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals
                          against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth 
                          assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal
                           contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick 
                           in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international
                            final.[491][492] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1–0 
                            in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since
                             1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[493][494] Messi was
                              directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting
                               five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared
                                with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament's top scorer with four goals tied with
                                 Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.
                                 <br><br>
                                 In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match
                                 appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming 
                                 in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal
                                  in each round of a single World Cup edition.[509] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was
                                   erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score
                                    again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 
                                    3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal
                                     in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for
                                      the trophy.[510] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the 
                                      first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in
                                       seven games, one behind Mbappé.[509] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi 
                                       overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the
                                        player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).
                                        [511] The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media
                                         coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé.[512][513][514][515] 
                                         Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team
                                         , saying "I want to continue playing as a champion"

<h1><u><i>Club Career</i></u></h1>
<h2><u>Barcelona</u></h2>
<br>
<h3>2003–2005: Rise to the first team:</h3>
<p>
     During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through 
    the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[31] After being named 
    player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, 
    he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he
     scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[32][33] Messi was then one of several youth players called up
      to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly 
      explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He
       destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid,
        he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the 
        team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout 
        the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[37][43] Since his debut the previous November, he had not
         been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank
          Rijkaard to promote him.[37] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi 
          from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing 
          him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[44][45] Messi made
           his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Olímpic Lluís 
           Companys in Montjuïc, coming on in the 82nd minute.[22] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days 
           old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.
           [39] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season,
            including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[43] He scored his
             first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at
              that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[44][46] Barcelona, in their second season 
              under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.
              <h3>2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player:</h3>
              <p>
                On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him
                 a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause
                  increased to €150 million.[41] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the
                   Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave 
                   a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp
                    Nou.[48] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his 
                    €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[49] According to then-president Joan Laporta, 
                    it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to 
                    stay.[50] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and 
                    extended to 2014
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving 
                    the nickname "Messiah" from the Spanish media.[19][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him 
                    award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,
                     behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains 
                     voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[75][76] Although he
                      managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again
                       marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score 
                       twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming 
                       the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the
                        return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, 
                        leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every
                         match.[78] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League
                          semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[80]
              </p>
              <h3>2008–09: First treble:</h3>
              <p>
                As the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91]
                 Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.
                 [87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. 
                 Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from 
                 a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the
                  history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 
                  September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, 
                  while his salary increased to €12 million.[
              </p>
              <h3>2009–10: First Ballon d'Or:</h3>
              <p>
                His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the 
                , winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[93] After victories in the Supercopa de España 
                 UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata 
                  19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[94] At 22 years old, Messi 
                   the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the biggest voting 
                    in each trophy's history
              </p>
              <h3>2010–2011: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League:</h3>
              <p>
                As Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[116] 
                he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the
                 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[117][118][119] He began the 
                 campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa 
                 de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking
                  Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals.[120][121] At the close of the year,
                   on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos,
                    earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.
                    [122] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth
                     player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and 
                     Marco van Basten.[123] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a 
                     revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[124] By then, Messi was already widely considered one of
                      the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[2
              </p>
              <h3>2012: A record-breaking year:</h3>
              <p>

                As Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw
                 him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league
                  fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against
                  Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In
                   addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer
                    with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only 
                    the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later
                    , on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking 
                    the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.
              </p>
              <h3>2013–2014: Messidependencia:</h3>
              <p>
                Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 
                100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half
                 of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health.[144] After losing 
                 successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first
                  knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to
                   a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi.[145] Now in his ninth senior season with 
                   Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018,
                    while his fixed wage rose to €13 million.[146][147] He wore the captain's armband for the first 
                    time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become
                     the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona 
                     players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false 
                     nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased; from 24% in their
                      treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.
              </p>
              <h3>2014–15: Second treble:</h3>
              <p>
                In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over 
                Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[184] His second goal, which came only three
                 minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past
                  Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most 
                  tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[185][186] Despite
                   a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated 
                   Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[187][188]
                    Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second
                     as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the 
                     match-winning goal on the rebound.[177] In addition to being the top assist provider with six
                      assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned
                       him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five 
                       Champions League seasons.[189][190] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA 
                       Best Player in Europe award for a second time.
              </p>
              <h3>2015–16: Domestic success:</h3>
            <p>
                Messi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5–4 victory (after extra time)
                 over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[192] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 
                 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[193] After a knee injury,
                  he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4–0 away 
                  win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[194] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015
                   FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona 
                   defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his
                    career.[197] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against 
                    Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Messi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the 
                    absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta;[207] he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla 
                    in the first leg on 14 August,[208] and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 
                    August.[209] Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6–2 against Real Betis in the 
                    opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On 4 February 2017, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao 
                    in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.[219] On 23 April,
                     Messi scored twice in a 3–2 away win over Real Madrid. His game-winning goal in stoppage time was his
                      500th for Barcelona.[220] His memorable celebration saw him taking off his Barcelona shirt and
                       holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing the crowd.[221] On
                        27 May, Messi scored a goal and set up another for Paco Alcácer in the 2017 Copa del Rey final,
                         helping Barcelona to a 3–1 victory over Alavés, and was named Man of the Match.[222] In total,
                          Messi finished the 2016–17 season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim 
                          both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.

            <h3>2017–18: Domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot:</h3>
            <p>
                On 4 March, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1–0 home win over Atlético Madrid, in La Liga.
                [235] On 14 March, Messi scored his 99th and 100th Champions League goals in a 3–0 home win over
                 Chelsea, becoming only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this landmark, in fewer
                  appearances, at a younger age and having taken fewer shots than his Portuguese counterpart.[236]
                   His opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of
                    his career, as Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition for the eleventh 
                    consecutive season.[237] On 7 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Leganés including
                     his sixth goal scored from a free-kick for the season, matching the record set by former 
                     teammate Ronaldinho.[238] He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, 
                     with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth Golden Shoe award.[239] On 21 April, Messi
                      scored Barcelona's second goal – his 40th of the season – in a 5–0 win over Sevilla in the
                       2018 Copa del Rey final, later also setting up Suárez's second goal; this was Barcelona's
                        fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall.[240] On 29 April, Messi scored a hat-trick 
                        in a 4–2 away win over Deportivo de La Coruña, which saw Barcelona claim their 25th league 
                        title.[241] On 9 May, Messi scored as Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest
                         unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.

            <p>
                On 13 January 2019, Messi scored his 400th La Liga goal in his 435th league appearance in a 3–0 home win 
                over Eibar, becoming the first player ever to manage this tally in just one of Europe's top five
                 leagues.[248] On 2 February, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 draw against Valencia, with his first
                  goal coming from the penalty spot, his 50th La Liga penalty goal; as such, he became only the
                   third player in La Liga history after Cristiano Ronaldo and Hugo Sánchez to score 50 penalties
                    in the competition.

                    <br>
                    n 27 April, Messi came off the bench and scored the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Levante, which 
                    allowed Barcelona to clinch the league title;[254] this was his 450th La Liga appearance, and his 
                    first league title as Barcelona's captain.[255][256] On 1 May, Messi scored twice in a 3–0 home win
                     over Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals; his second goal of the match,
                      a 35-yard free kick, was the 600th senior club goal of his career, all of which had been scored
                       with Barcelona.[257] In the return leg six days later at Anfield, Barcelona suffered a 4–0 away 
                       defeat, which saw Liverpool advance to the final 4–3 on aggregate.[258] On 19 May, in Barcelona's
                        final La Liga match of the season, Messi scored twice in a 2–2 away draw against Eibar
                         (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth
                          Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, 
                          he equalled Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga.[259][260] He also
                           captured his sixth Golden Shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016–17
                            season.[261] On 25 May, Messi scored his final goal of the season in a 2–1 defeat to Valencia

            <h3>2019–20: Record sixth Ballon d'Or:</h3>
            <p>
                On 27 November, in what was his 700th appearance for Barcelona, Messi scored one goal and assisted two 
                more in a 3–1 home win over Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League. Dortmund were the 34th
                 team he had scored against in the competition, breaking the previous record of 33 held by Cristiano
                  Ronaldo and Raúl.[275] On 2 December, Messi was awarded a record-breaking sixth Ballon d'Or.[276]
                   On 8 December, Messi scored his record-breaking 35th hat-trick in La Liga with three goals in 
                   Barcelona's 5–2 home win over Mallorca.
                <br>
                <br>
                On 22 February 2020, Messi scored four goals in a 5–0 home win over Eibar in La Liga.[278]
                 On 14 June, he scored in a 4–0 away win against Mallorca, becoming the first player ever
                  in La Liga to score 20 goals or more in 12 consecutive seasons.[279] On 30 June, he 
                  scored a panenka in a 2–2 home draw against Atlético Madrid in La Liga, to reach his 
                  700th goal in his senior career for Barcelona and Argentina.[280] On 11 July, Messi
                   provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over
                    Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi's record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season
                     from 2008 to 2009;[281][282] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player
                      ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal 
                      (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single
                       league season in one of Europe's top-five leagues.[282][283] Following his brace 
                       in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi
                        finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga,
                         with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh
                          Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league
                           title to Real Madrid.[284] On 9 August, in the Champions League round of 16
                            second leg versus Napoli at the Camp Nou, Messi scored the second goal and 
                            earned a penalty which led to a third goal and led his side to a 3–1 home 
                            victory and qualified 4–2 on aggregate for the quarter-finals against Bayern 
                            Munich.[285] On 15 August, Messi suffered his worst defeat as a player as 
                            Bayern Munich beat Barcelona 8–2 in a one-off tie in Lisbon, leading to
                             another disappointing exit from the Champions League.

            <h3>August 2020: Desire to leave Barcelona:</h3>
            <p>
                On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel's father and agent, released a statement in response
                 to La Liga claiming the release clause "is not valid when the termination of the contract
                  is by the player's unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season", as stated 
                  in Messi's contract with Barcelona;[294] moments later, La Liga issued a response 
                  reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[295] Later that evening, Messi 
                  announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final 
                  year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of
                   his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi
                   
                   could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for
                    bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[296] This left Messi with two options: to
                     stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying "I would never go
                      to court against the club of my life".
            </p>
            <h3>
                2020–21: Final season at Barcelona:
            </h3>
            <p>
                On 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[317] with negotiations on a new 
                deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[318] On 5 August, Barcelona 
                 that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and 
                 were due to sign a contract that day.[319] The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed
                  by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[320] Club president Joan Laporta also
                   blamed the previous board for Messi's exit by saying "the basis of everything is the calamitous
                    and disastrous situation left by the previous board", he added by saying "the expected debt is
                     much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary"
                     .[321] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed 
                     that he would be leaving Barcelona.
            </p>
            <h2><u>Paris Saint-Germain</u></h2>
            <br>
            <h3>2021–22: First season adjustments:</h3>
            <p>
                On 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).[323] He signed a
                 two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[324] Messi chose
                  30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior
                   debut for Barcelona.<br><br>

Messi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of a
 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1.[326] He made his first start and Champions League debut for
  the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September.[327] Four days later, Messi made
   his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[328] On 28 September, he scored his first goal for
    the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box in a 2–0 Champions League group stage win over
     former manager Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.[329] On 21 November, Messi scored his first Ligue 1
      goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes.[330] Later that month, he provided a hat-trick of assists
       for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home.[331] Having scored
        40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021
         Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or on 29 November.
            </p>
            <h3>2022–23: Return to form and departure:</h3>
            <p>
                On 26 February 2023, PSG defeated Marseille 3–0 in Le Classique, with Messi scoring his 700th
                 senior career club goal as well as assisting two goals for Mbappé.[351] On 11 March, PSG defeated
                  Brest 2–1, with Messi setting up a last-minute winner for Mbappé, registering his 300th career
                   assist.[352] On 8 April, he scored and provided an assist in a 2–0 away win over Nice in Ligue 1,
                    which saw him overtake Cristiano Ronaldo as the all–time highest goalscorer in European club
                     football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal 
                     contributions at club level.[353][354] On 2 May, Messi was suspended for two weeks and 
                     fined after taking an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia with his family as part of a
                      promotional commercial agreement. His visit to Saudi Arabia meant he did not show up to
                       training the previous day following a 3–1 defeat to Lorient.[355] The next day, on 3 May,
                       it was reported that Messi would leave PSG at the end of the season, following the expiry
                        of his contract.[356] Afterwards, several PSG supporters demanded his exit from the club
                        , viewing his absence as evidence of a team not fighting for the shirt, within a context
                         of perceived disconnect between themselves and the club's identity.[357] Two days later
                         , Messi apologised to the club and his teammates for the trip, stating he thought he had
                          a free day after the match [against Lorient], and already had the trip planned, which
                          he had canceled previously.[358] On 28 May, Messi scored in a 1–1 draw against Strasbourg 
                          helping PSG clinch their 11th Ligue 1 title and his second in a row; in the process Messi 
                          became the player with the most goals in the history of Europe's top five leagues, with 496 
                          goals.
            </p>
            <h2><u>Inter Miami</u></h2>
            <p>
                Following confirmation of his departure from PSG, Messi was linked with a return to former club Barcelona,
                 as well as with a big-money move to Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal, but his eventual
                  decision to sign for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami was communicated to Barcelona president 
                  Joan Laporta by 5 June 2023.[364][365] Barcelona were unable to sign him due to financial 
                  constraints.[366]<br><br>

On 7 June, Inter Miami posted a video on their social media hinting at the club's signing of Messi, although it did 
not confirm that he had officially signed yet.[367] On the same day, Messi confirmed his intention to
 join Miami in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and Sport, in which he said that they "haven't 
 closed it 100 percent"; MLS also stated that the deal had not been finalised.[368] He explained that
  even though La Liga had accepted everything and was fine for him to return to Barcelona, there were 
  many things left to be done such as lowering salaries and selling players, and he did not want to go
   through it again or be responsible for it.[369] He confirmed that other European clubs approached him,
    but that Barcelona was the only European team he wanted to play for
